This is a repo containing solutions to sslotin's [compilation](https://ru.algorithmica.org/cs/programming/bayans/) of "well-known problems" (or "bayan" as they're called in Russian) algorithmic and math adjacent problems. It's strongly reccommended to view the notebook in VSCode with a Jupyter Notebook extension or in Colab.
